For more information, please check the [ReadMe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o_dMlZhIpucZGtEF9eofafJ3Mwk8GFkrR38zAQ_ZxAU/edit?usp=sharing) and [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s68uUPHb78qIkNahJk7EgeQmKqdoyk5m/view?usp=sharing).

*Where is the data, and what is there?* FAIRkit uses a form structure to inventory study-level metadata, including sharing permissions, governance, and data location both in FAIRplex buckets and in the contributing AMP.

*What do these data fields represent?* FAIRkit already contains over 110k common data elements (CDEs) that incoming clinical data can be matched to. Its offline tooling ensures that each data field across interoperable datasets have the same names and represents the same meanings, units of measure and valid ranges. New CDEs can also be generated rapidly leveraging AI-assistance when needed. A collection of CDEs for all clinical and experimental data fields in FAIRplex datasets will be browsable by users and will also be mirrored by the National Library of Medicine’s CDE repository in the near future.

*How was this data made and harmonized?* All available documentation for experimental procedures associated with FAIRplex datasets, along with analysis and data management code, are indexed and summarized using AI-assistance to facilitate findability and intelligibility across groups of scientists from diverse scientific disciplines.

*What about federated data?* Logging in to FAIRkit will populate your federated authentication across the SysBio ecosystem. Through our graphical user interface (GUI), you can explore harmonized and centralized data of interest to the research community across multiple modalities without writing any code.

*Can I build a cohort?* Go right ahead. Through the federated data access, which is transient and temporary for that login, you can export a “shopping list” style inventory of samples of interest at each AMPs where the bulk of connected data is stored long term. Find the samples you want, use the provenance and findability data you just downloaded to go on a deep dive in BAM files or brain images at the host AMP without having to look for hours.
