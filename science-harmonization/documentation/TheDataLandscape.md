# The AMP Data Landscape
The AMP Program supports Projects across multiple diseases and disorders with the shared goal of improving the understanding of therapeutically relevant biological pathways and identifying therapeutic targets ([see](https://www.nih.gov/amp/amp-projects) to learn more). The AMP Projects support a variety of different studies and generate multiple data modalities, most focused on genetic and omic data generated from disease-relevant tissues. These data are provided to the research community at different processing and summarization levels, accompanied by different phenotypes, specimen, and assay metadata variables. The AMP Projects provide these data to the research community through individual AMP Portals that are specific to each disease area and built on different data hosting architectures. Together, this heterogeneity makes the analysis of data originating from multiple AMP Projects challenging.

SysBio-FAIRplex aims to unlock the full potential of the AMP Projects by enabling cross-disease systems biology research. It does this through a platform that provides access to primary data originating from the AMP Projects data and data made interoperable through common standards to simplify data discovery and use.

# The AMP Projects

The AMP Program and individual AMP Projects are described by the [FNIH](https://fnih.org/our-programs/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp/) and in the [SysBio FAIRplex portal](https://portal-1099008379867.us-central1.run.app/).

Ther initial focus is on the AMP Projects with genetics and omics (bulk and single cell transcriptomics, and proteomics) data that are available as of September 2025, or anticipated to become available by the end of the SysBio FAIRplex funding period.
