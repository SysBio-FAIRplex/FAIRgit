# Science, Harmonization and Search Team
The SysBio FAIRplex teams are developing a federated data platform designed to promote collaborative, transparent, and reproducible research following FAIR principles. The FAIRplex platform will enable researchers to discover and access data from the Accelerating <a href="https://fnih.org/our-programs/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp/">Medicines Partnership® (AMP®) program</a>. Central to the platform will be a catalog of AMP datasets that are harmonized into a Common Data Model (SysBio CDM) for indexing, search, and combined analysis. The CDM will leverage foundational data engineering efforts and guidelines preceding the SysBio FAIRplex, such as Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI), Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP), and the NLM CDE Repository.

See the documentation for a description of the SysBio FAIRplex data landscape, data harmonization methods, and data model. The SysBio FAIRplex platform will serve as a central location for performing data discovery through FAIRkit, data exploration through visualization tools hosted in the FAIRplex platform, and data analysis through direct download where permitted, or in cloud workspaces such as the Verily Workbench.
