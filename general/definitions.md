# SysBio-FAIRplex Definitions

| Term | Description |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| AMP Portal | A general term for platforms hosting AMP project data |
| AMP Program | The FNIH term for the whole program |
| AMP Project | The FNIH term for individual AMPs |
| Centralized data | Data hosted in one repository |
| Dataset | A structured, provenance-tracked collection of information elements with a defined schema and explicit terms of use and stewardship, that supports discovery, access, interpretation, and reuse according to FAIR principles. Different repositories have flexibility in how they translate their data into a FAIRplex Dataset, which may be driven by practical, real-world scientific use-cases. In practice, a Dataset should fall under a single data use access process. Different tiers (registered, controlled, controlled plus) may have different activities to receive access approval. |
| Federated data | Interoperable data hosted in multiple repositories |
| Genetics assays | Assays that target DNA, including but not limited to whole genome sequencing, array genotyping, and/or imputation of genotypes |
| Harmonized data | Data that has been processed jointly using the same or functionally equivalent pipelines. Data that can be easily centralized. Harmonized data is inherently interoperable. |
| Interoperable data | Data that has been processed using different pipelines. Data is made interoperable through the same headers and content representations across studies. |
| Metadata | FAIRplex uses the term “metadata” in its classical sense of “data about data”. We apply the term to datasets and samples. We do NOT apply the term to phenotypic/clinical data from research study participants. |
| Omics assays | Assays that target RNA, Proteins, Metabolites, and other molecules, generally with the gene as a functional unit for analyses |
| Summary data | Aggregate analysis results |
| Synthetic data | Data that has been randomized and fully anonymized |.......
